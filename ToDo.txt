ToDo:

This file contains misc notes on things I plan to get to.  It's included with
the addon because I'm too lazy not to include it.

	make all filter functions take slot, item for consistency

	filter:iterate(func)
		calls func(slot, details) on each item, returning
		list of items for which func returned true
	filter:first(func)
		calls func(slot, details) on each item, returning
		{ slot, item } table containing the first item which
		got nil
	filter:include/exclude(func)
		calls func on item and uses return value
