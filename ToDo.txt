ToDo:

This file contains misc notes on things I plan to get to.  It's included with
the addon because I'm too lazy not to include it.

	* Make split smart enough to notice if it might run out of
	  slots.
	* Add convenience stuff like "count empty slots"

Filter editor support is very primitive.  I want to add things like pop-ups
for matches, and a better way to handle require/exclude tags, but I
haven't gotten that far yet.
